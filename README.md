# 🚀 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to the digital home of someone who turns coffee into code and data into insights. This is where I showcase my journey from crunching numbers at Bajaj Finserv to pursuing ML dreams at Northeastern University.

## 🎨 What's This All About?

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React, TypeScript, and enough CSS to make it look pretty without breaking the internet. It's got a subtle Star Wars vibe (because who doesn't love a good starfield?), smooth animations, and all my professional achievements neatly organized for your viewing pleasure.

**Live Site:** [semwalhritvik.github.io](https://semwalhritvik.github.io)

## 🛠️ Built With

* React 18 (because we like hooks)
* TypeScript (for that sweet type safety)
* Tailwind CSS (utility classes for days)
* Framer Motion (making things move smoothly since forever)
* Vite (fast builds, faster coffee breaks)
* A sprinkle of determination and Stack Overflow

## 🎯 Features

* **Animated Starfield Background** → Because space is cool and parallax is cooler
* **Smooth Scrolling** → Your mouse wheel will thank me
* **Responsive Design** → Looks good on your phone, tablet, desktop, and probably your smart fridge
* **Project Showcase** → All my work in one scrollable gallery
* **Easy to Update** → Just edit the data files, no component surgery required

## 📁 Project Structure

The magic happens in these folders:

* `src/components/` → All the UI pieces
* `src/data/` → Where I keep my projects, experience, skills (edit these to update content!)
* `src/pages/` → The main pages
* `public/` → Static assets and images

## 🚀 Running Locally

Want to see this beauty on your machine?

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/semwalhritvik/semwalhritvik.github.io.git

# Jump into the folder
cd semwalhritvik.github.io

# Install the good stuff
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:8080 and enjoy
```

No need to touch any components. I made it easy because future me will forget how React works.

## 🤖 Deployment

This site auto deploys via GitHub Actions whenever I push to main. It's like having a robot assistant, except this one actually works.

The workflow builds the site, optimizes everything, and deploys it to GitHub Pages. All I have to do is push my code and trust the process.

## 🎓 About Me

I'm Hritvik Semwal, a Data Science grad student at Northeastern University with a thing for building ML models that actually work in production. Previously spent 3+ years at Bajaj Finserv making data dance.

Currently seeking Summer 2026 Data Science internships where I can apply my skills to solve real problems (and maybe grab some free snacks).

## 📜 License

This project is open source and available for anyone who wants to use it as inspiration. Just don't copy paste my resume, that would be weird.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

* Coffee, for being there when I needed it most
* Stack Overflow, for answering questions I didn't know I had
* That one YouTube tutorial that actually worked
* My keyboard, for enduring countless hours of typing
* Anthropic's Claude, for helping me debug at 2 AM

## 🐛 Found a Bug?

Congratulations! You've discovered an undocumented feature. Feel free to open an issue or, better yet, submit a PR and become part of this legendary codebase.

## ⭐ Like What You See?

Give this repo a star! It doesn't cost you anything, but it makes me feel like a rockstar developer for approximately 3.5 seconds, which is nice.
